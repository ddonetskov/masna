# Project Description

The network chosen for the project is the set of R packages built from two subsets

* the base packages
* the packages available on CRAN

with dependencies between them. The network data was gathered by using the
01_build_net.R script.

There are four types of links between packages

* "Depends". Directive attempts to ensure that a function from another package 
is available by attaching the other package to the main search path 
(i.e. the list of environments returned by search()). Which sometimes can lead 
to collisions with names. It's not recommended type of dependency).
* "Imports". Packages listed here must be present for your package to work. 
In fact, any time your package is installed, those packages will, if not already 
present, be installed on your computer (devtools::load_all() also checks that
the packages are installed). However, it does not mean that it will be attached 
along with your package. The best practice is to explicitly refer to external 
functions using the syntax package::function().
* "Suggests". Your package can use these packages, but doesn’t require them. 
You might use suggested packages for example datasets, to run tests, build 
vignettes, or maybe there’s only one function that needs the package. Packages 
listed in Suggests are not automatically installed along with your package.
* "Enhances". Packages listed here are “enhanced” by your package. Typically, 
this means you provide methods for classes defined in another package 
(a sort of reverse Suggests). But it’s hard to define what that means, 
so I don’t recommend using Enhances.

The "Suggests" and "Enhances" relations are out of scope for the project as they 
don't impose hard dependency i.e. a package may work without them. Further,
we consider only the "Depends" and "Imports" relations and consider them equal
from our research's point of view.

The motivation is to investigate into what are the most 'powerful' R packages in
terms of their relations to the rest of packages.

# Data Format

The network data is saved in two formats:

* the GML format in the r_packages.gml file,
* the Pajek format in the r_packages.net file.

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)
net <- read_graph("r_packages.gml", format = "gml")
```

# Basic Network Characteristics 

The nodes represent web pages, each page describes some Wikipedia social norm. 
The links are the HTTP reference from one page to another.

It's a directed graph by its nature, no weights assigned to the links.

|Property              | Value |
|:---------------------|:-----------------|
| Vertices, number     | `r length(V(net))`                                   |
| Arcs, number         | `r length(E(net))`                                   |
| Average degree       | `r round(2*length(E(net))/length(V(net)), 1)`        |
| Diameter             | `r diameter(net, directed = TRUE, weights = NULL)`   |
| Acyclic?             | `r is.dag(net)`                                      |

Interesting to note there are isolated packages i.e. without any relations to any
other packages, their percentage is

```{r, echo=F}
round(100*mean(degree(net, mode = "all") == 0), 1)
```

## Top Nodes

The most popular packages in terms of others depending on them, the 

The first 50 nodes with the largest number of in-degree. The high number of 
total degree for a node is expectedly provided by incoming dependecies. 
```{r, echo=F}

net_deg_all <- degree(net, mode = "all")
net_deg_in  <- degree(net, mode = "in")
net_deg_out <- degree(net, mode = "out")

print(sprintf("%-36s %-10s %10s %10s %16s", "Page Name", "Type", "In-degree", "Out-degree", "Total Degree"), quote = F)
print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", quote = F)
for (node_id in order(net_deg_all, decreasing = T)[1:50]) {
  print(sprintf("%-36s %-10s %10d %10d %16d", 
    V(net)$name[node_id],
    V(net)$type[node_id],
    net_deg_in [[node_id]],
    net_deg_out[[node_id]],
    net_deg_all[[node_id]]), 
    quote = F)
}
```

The most dependent packages (sorted in the descending order of out-degree)

```{r, echo=F}

print(sprintf("%-36s %-10s %10s %10s %16s", "Page Name", "Type", "In-degree", "Out-degree", "Total Degree"), quote = F)
print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------", quote = F)
for (node_id in order(net_deg_out, decreasing = T)[1:10]) {
  print(sprintf("%-36s %-10s %10d %10d %16d", 
    V(net)$name[node_id],
    V(net)$type[node_id],
    net_deg_in [[node_id]],
    net_deg_out[[node_id]],
    net_deg_all[[node_id]]), 
    quote = F)
}
```

## Components

## Density

The proportion of present edges from all possible edges in the network.
```{r, echo=F}
# for undirected network
# edge_density(net, loops=F)

# for directed network
ecount(net)/(vcount(net)*(vcount(net)-1))
```

The nodes along the first found path of the diameter distance.
```{r}
V(net)$name[get.diameter(net)]
```

# Degree

The degree distribution (in-degree, out-degree, total)

```{r}
# Degree
net_deg_in  <- degree(net, mode = "in")
net_deg_out <- degree(net, mode = "out")
net_deg_all <- degree(net, mode = "all")

par(mfrow = c(1,3))
hist(net_deg_in,  breaks = 20, freq = T, main = "", xlab = "Degree (In)")
hist(net_deg_out, breaks = 20, freq = T, main = "", xlab = "Degree (Out)")
hist(net_deg_all, breaks = 20, freq = T, main = "", xlab = "Degree (All)")
```

```{r, echo = F}
net_deg_dist_all <- degree_distribution(net, cumulative=T, mode="all")
net_deg_dist_in  <- degree_distribution(net, cumulative=T, mode="in")
net_deg_dist_out <- degree_distribution(net, cumulative=T, mode="out")

par(mfrow=c(3,1))

plot(x = 0:max(degree(net, mode="all")), 
     y = 1 - net_deg_dist_all, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 1.2, 
     col = "orange", 
     xlab = "Degree (All)", 
     ylab = "Cumulative Frequency")

plot(x = 0:max(degree(net, mode="in")), 
     y = 1 - net_deg_dist_in, 
     pch=19, 
     cex=1.2, 
     col  = "orange", 
     xlab = "Degree (In)", 
     ylab = "Cumulative Frequency")

plot(x = 0:max(degree(net, mode="Out")), 
     y = 1 - net_deg_dist_out, 
     pch = 19, 
     cex = 1.2, 
     col = "orange", 
     xlab = "Degree (Out)", 
     ylab = "Cumulative Frequency")
```

# Nodes

The nodes, as previously said, are R packages. 


# Our network without isolated nodes


net2 <- delete.vertices(net, V(net)[degree(net) == 0])
V(net2)$size <- degree(net2)

# Our network without nodes with small number of degrees
net2 <- delete.vertices(net, V(net)[degree(net) < 100])

plot(net2, layout = layout_with_fr(net2), edge.arrow.size = .4, edge.curved = .1)

-->

<!--

Let's create a heatmap of nodes with more than 200 in-degree links.

```{r}
netm <- get.adjacency(net, sparse = F) # , attr="weight", sparse=F)

colnames(netm) <- V(net)$media
rownames(netm) <- V(net)$media

palf <- colorRampPalette(c("white", "dark orange")) 

heatmap(netm[,10:1], Rowv = NA, Colv = NA, col = palf(10), 
        scale="none", margins=c(10,10) )
```
-->

# Betweenness

```{r}
net_bt = betweenness(net, v = V(net), directed = TRUE)
hist(net_bt, breaks = 30, freq = T, main = "", xlab = "Betweenness")

# net_eb <- cluster_edge_betweenness(net, directed = TRUE)
# plot_dendrogram(net_eb)
```


# Subnetworks

In trying to determine subnetworks with the we find there are hundrends of one 
node networks (isolated nodes) and one large subnetwork of 10406 nodes. 

That's shown on the histogram below where x is ln of the size 
of each of those networks

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
net_dec <- decompose.graph(net)
net_sn_len <- c()
for (i in 1:length(net_dec)) { 
  net_sn_len <- c(net_sn_len, length(V(net_dec[[i]]))) 
}
hist(log(net_sn_len, 10), breaks = 5, xlab = "ln(<number of nodes>")
```

# Communities

TBC...

Determine communities using walktrap algorithm (igraph)

```{r, echo = F}
net_cl <- walktrap.community(net, steps = 3)

# Define ob
topClusters <- table(net_cl$membership) %>% 
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>% 
  head(25)

topClusters[1:10]

plot(topClusters[1:10],  main="Cluster size (Top 10)", ylab="Number of members", type="b", lwd=2)
```


<!--
-- Check it for comminuties detection: http://kateto.net/networks-r-igraph

Community detection (betweenness), up to 10 communities

```{r, eval=F}
net_eb <- edge.betweenness.community(net)

membership <- cut_at(net_eb, no = 10)
plot(net,
  vertex.color= rainbow(10, .8, .8, alpha=.8)[membership],
  vertex.size=5, layout=layout,  vertex.label=NA,
  edge.arrow.size=.2)
```




```{r, eval=F}
betweenness(net)
edge.betweenness(net)

plot(net, layout=layout,
  vertex.size = map(betweenness(net),c(1,15)),
  edge.width = map(edge.betweenness(net), c(1,10)))
```
-->

# Visualization

Visualization was made in Gephi with manual configuration. An effort of doing 
the same with igraph provides suboptimal results of nodes and edges overlapping 
each other.

The size of nodes reflects the number of in-degrees for that node. The color of 
node reflects which type ('base', 'CRAN') it belongs to.

The visualization demonstrates the network is centered around several large nodes.

The visualization also saved as R_packages_vis.pdf.

# Ideas to Improve Report

1. Dendrogram? Will it work for such a large network?
2. Try the hierarchical clustering.
3. Provide more interpretaion of the network.
